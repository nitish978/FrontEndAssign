                       Front-end Engineering Assignment

Installation of software:-
        Install Python 2.7 in linux.
        Install DJANGO using pip in linux.
				Make sure your Django should be in ['/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/django'].
Functionalities of the software:-
				Record your expenses on daily basis:-
				In this you can add your grocery expenses, entertainment expenses, Food expenses, vehicle expenses and  miscellaneous 		expenses.
				You can add the above mentioned expenses in the given dialogue box.
Visualization of expenses by graph:-
			You can check your all expenses.
			I used  a bar graph to visualize expenses according to daily basis and monthly basis.
			In monthly basis you have to enter the dates form where to where you want to check your expenses by visualization.
			While in daily basis you donâ€™t have to enter any date as it will automatically display the expense of that day.
Tracking of all the daily basis expenses:-
			You have to select any one of the category mentioned to check your total expense on that category.
			GUI of the software:-
			I used HTML , BOOTSTRAP to build front-end of my software.
			To display the graph for visualization of the daily and monthly expenses i used CHART.JS .
Back-end of the software:-
				I used Python to create back-end.
				I used  Python framework Django to connect the front-end and back-end.
				I used Django framework as it is easy to implement and in less lines of code also you can develop a better webpage.
				Django is not directly connected to the server, it creates an interface between your server and front-end.
				It also helps to protect your server from garbage values.
